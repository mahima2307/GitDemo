To include file in Github from local editor:
Open the local folder that needs to uploaded to Github in file explorer, click on file path and replace with "cmd".
This opens the command prompt for that folder then run the following.

>> For 1st time need to configure github in our system
git config --global user.name "mahima2307"
git config --global user.email "mahimanshah123@gmail.com"
git config --global color.ui auto

Mandatory Commands:
>> git init
To initialize git folder. After this command we can see the .git folder in the folder which is connected to git. If not view->check "Hidden Files" checkbox and then check for folder.

>> git remote add origin (RepoURL)
RepoURL can be found by Github->code->local->HTTPS->copy link and replace for (RepoURL) in the command above.
To make a remote connection to our application, that is connection between local editor to github account.


Now, to have the file from Github to editor we need to pull the files(Cloning):
Go to the editor-> ... -> New Terminal-->Now ensure that the file path is same as the folder we have in 
github; else go to explorer on left, right click on that folder and click "Open in Integrated Terminal".
And then write following command in that terminal.
>>git pull origin main
Here main is the name of the branch.
The above command brings all the changes made or the files added to github(and not the local editor) to the 
local editor.
This process is called cloning.

Now to have the files present in local editor to Github, we need to push the files
So first, run the following command to check the files in editor, which are not in github. They appear in red on running git status.
>>git status

Then to add these files to git, use:
>>git add .
The above command adds all the files to git.

Then we can check the status again using:
>>git status
Now all the files that appeared in red while using the previous git status, appears green, indicating that these
files are now added to git.
But now if we check in github for these files, they are not found so we need to commit using:
>>git commit -m "any message"
Then we refresh github again, but still files arent found there.So next do:
>>git push
A command will be displayed when above command written. This command is to be run next.
After running this, when we check in github, a master branch appears which would have all the files.
But we need these files in main branch, for that compare and pull request( base:main <- compare:master ) and go on and confirm merge, after which all the files appear in main as well as master branch.
